## Why?

A game where players deploy [bots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot) to play a game is not new (e.g. [screeps.com](https://screeps.com)), but because existing games host player-written scripts for the players, it is not scalable to the usage of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) techniques. By allowing players to host their own scripts, gameplay can scale to complex emergent agent behaviors.
